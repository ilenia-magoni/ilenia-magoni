### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ilenia, I hail from Italy.
I am a contributor for two open source projects, freecodecamp.org, more for other stuff than coding (translation, user support...), but I am learning.

I'm in the process of getting a Master's Degree in Chemistry (after a Bachelor's).
I'm also progressing through the freeCodeCamp curriculum.

As af August 2021 I also work for freeCodeCamp.
